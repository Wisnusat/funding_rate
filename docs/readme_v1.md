in my local device i don't know why it doesn't work without virtual environment. so i recommend you to create it if you see any error.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

after that you can install the required packages using pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then you can run the application using the following command.

```
python app.py
``
